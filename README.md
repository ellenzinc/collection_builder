# collection_builder

## Function
The source code enables an automatic transformation of .bib files to files for Jekyll collection. 
For each entry in the .bib file, a collection entry is created with file name "[id].md", where "id" is the bibtex key. 

## Usage
For proper use of the functions, bibtexparser package is needed. 
Detailed installation guide and documentation can be found at
https://bibtexparser.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html

## Roadmap
1. Sort by descending publication date
2. Make a standalone command line tool
